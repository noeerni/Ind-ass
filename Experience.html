<p><center>On 2016, I decided to find a job to earn some money since I've already finished the school. 
Plus, at that time I do not have enough money to buy my things such as skincare and makeup. Even though I am a naughty daughter, 
I want to be independent where I can give my parents money thatI earned, and I can buy the things that I want with my own money. 
So my story has began where I started working at a bakery. I do not have any experience plus I do not ever thought that I will started 
my first job at a bakery. On my very first day, I learned how to make the dough, use the machine, and how to bake. My boss teach me 
everything that I do not know. Well, my boss said it's normal since it is my first day working there. My boss said, "no need to shy when 
you do not have any experience but you must be shy when you don't want to learn the anything". Her words really make me like woke up 
from a sleep. Since then I learn and work very hard. It is not because of the wages. It's all about the experience and everyday I learn 
something new! Unfortunately, without I realized my right hand start feel the pain again. When I was 16 years old, I broke my right hand. 
I fell down from a broken chair in school. Since then the doctor said that I cannot do rough work because it will harm my hand later. 
That thing became real when I woke up in the morning and my hand feel so much pain so I cannot go to work. The doctor said I should quit 
from doing any hard work. I feel so sad because I just started the work around one week. But I don't want to feel the pain again so I 
quit the job. My mom said it's okay since I can't do hard work. My family understand me so well. They support me 100%. Since then I no 
longer work until now. Sad but that's the true :')</p>
